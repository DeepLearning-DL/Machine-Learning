<h1>Logistic Regression</h1>
In statistics, the logistic model is used to model the probability of a certain class or event<br>
existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model<br>
several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc.<br>
<br>
Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the<br>
dependent variable is <b>dichotomous (binary).</b>
