Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique.
It can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems.
In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. 
Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not 
contain any further branches.
