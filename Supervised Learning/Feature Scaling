# Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is a way of transforming your data into a common range of values. There are two common scalings:

1. Standardizing
2. Normalizing

Standardizing

Standardizing is completed by taking each value of your column, subtracting the mean of the column,
and then dividing by the standard deviation of the column
