# Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is a way of transforming your data into a common range of values. There are two common scalings:

1. Standardizing
2. Normalizing

Standardizing

Standardizing is completed by taking each value of your column, subtracting the mean of the column,and then dividing by the
standard deviation of the column.
Let's take example in Python consider you have a column in df called height. You could create a standardized height as:
  df["height_standard"] = (df["height"] - df["height"].mean()) / df["height"].std()
