# Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is a way of transforming your data into a common range of values. There are two common scalings:

1. Standardizing
2. Normalizing

# Standardizing

Standardizing is completed by taking each value of your column, subtracting the mean of the column,and then dividing by the
standard deviation of the column.
Let's take example in Python consider you have a column in df called height. You could create a standardized height as:
df["height_standard"] = (df["height"] - df["height"].mean()) / df["height"].std()

This will create a new "standardized" column where each value is a comparison to the mean of the column, and a new, standardized value 
can be interpreted as the number of standard deviations the original height was from the mean

# Normalizing

The second type of feature scaling that is very popular is normalizing. With normalizing, data are scaled between 0 and 1.
Using the same example as above, we could perform normalizing in Python in the following way:
df["height_normal"] = (df["height"] - df["height"].min()) /     \
                      (df["height"].max() - df['height'].min())
