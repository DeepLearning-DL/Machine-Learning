# Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.
It is more popular algorithm used for classification problems.

# SVM can be implemented in three different ways.

1. Maximum Margin Classifier
2. Classification with Inseparable Classes
3. Kernel Methods

Maximum Margin Classifier
When your data can be completely separated, the linear version of SVMs attempts to maximize the distance from the linear boundary to the closest points
(called the support vectors).

# Classification with Inseparable Classes

Data in the real world is rarely completely separable .So we introduced a new hyper-parameter called C.
The C hyper-parameter determines how flexible we are willing to be with the points that fall on the wrong side of our dividing boundary.
