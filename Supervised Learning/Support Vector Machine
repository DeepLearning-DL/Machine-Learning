Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.
It is more popular algorithm used for classification problems.

SVM can be implemented in three different ways.

1. Maximum Margin Classifier
2. Classification with Inseparable Classes
3. Kernel Methods

Maximum Margin Classifier
When your data can be completely separated, the linear version of SVMs attempts to maximize the distance from the linear boundary to the closest points
(called the support vectors).
