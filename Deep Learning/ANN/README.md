# Artificial Neural Network
An Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) is a computational model based on the <br>
structure and functions of biological neural networks. Information that flows<br>
through the network affects the structure of the ANN because a neural network<br>
changes - or learns, in a sense - based on that input and output.<br>

Alternatively, An Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) is a computational model based<br>
 on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. Information that<br> flows through the network affects the structure of the ANN because a neural <br>
 network changes - or learns, in a sense - based on that input and output.<br>
<br>
ANNs are considered nonlinear statistical data modeling tools where the complex<br> relationships between inputs and outputs are modeled or patterns are found.<br>

ANN is also known as a neural network.
